Tweaky and feature-rich file copy utility for Windows

---

I started this project way back in 2004 to address the annoyances in Windows XP's
file copy user interface. Specifically, it doesn't bail out and leave a half-finished
copy job when one file fails, and it has fewer annoying prompts, it can wait for
one copy job to finish before starting the next one, and a few other tweaky options.
Many of XP's annoyances have been resolved in subsequent Windows versions, but
PerigeeCopy still offers features Microsoft doesn't.

I don't use this utility much anymore, and frankly I'm a little embarrassed by it, but
it still has a small but loyal following. So I thought I'd put it on Github to make it
easier for the community to contribute.
